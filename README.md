```
 There are six patients and more in the ward without the designation of any employee. Occasionally, Dr. Schmidt supervises the ward. The patients feel unattended and poorly informed due to the lack of any technical or manual system to monitor their vital signs. Also, there are no alarms to transfer to other areas, so they sometimes have to wait excessively long periods alone.
